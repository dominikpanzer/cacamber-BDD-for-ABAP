# Architecture Decision Record: Cacamber Should Be Compatible With Netweaber 7.5x

## Status
accepted

## Context
Many companies running SAP don't update their systems regularly. Not everybody is using
the newest stack or is already running S/4HANA. The migration from the old Netweaver 
platform to S/4HANA will take years. ECC currently will ne supported by SAP until 2027.
Many developers can't use Cacamber if it is not compatible to older systems.

## Decision
Cacamber should be able to run on Netweaver 7.5x, but should also follow the ABAP Cloud
programming model to be future proof.

## Consequences
1. only ABAP language features compatible with 7.5x systems can be used
1. main development system needs to be ABAP Cloud ready
1. ABAP language version of the development objects needs to be "ABAP for Cloud Development"
1. PRs have to be checked regarding the ABAP Cloud readiness
1. PRs have to be checked regarding 7.5x compatibility
